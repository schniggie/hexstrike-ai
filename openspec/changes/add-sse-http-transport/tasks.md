# Implementation Tasks

## Summary of Completed Implementation (v6.1)

✅ **Core Achievement: Complete SSE/HTTP Transport Implementation**

**Two-Layer Architecture Successfully Implemented:**

1. **Layer 1: AI Agent ↔ hexstrike_mcp.py (MCP Protocol)**
   - ✅ SSE transport via FastMCP built-in support (`mcp.run(transport="sse")`)
   - ✅ Streamable-HTTP transport via FastMCP built-in support
   - ✅ CLI arguments: `--transport`, `--mcp-host`, `--mcp-port`
   - ✅ Remote AI agent connectivity over HTTP
   - ✅ Backward compatible stdio transport (default)

2. **Layer 2: hexstrike_mcp.py ↔ hexstrike_server.py (Internal)**
   - ✅ SessionManager with thread-safe session handling
   - ✅ SSE endpoints: `/api/mcp/session`, `/api/mcp/sse`
   - ✅ Real-time command execution event streaming
   - ✅ SSETransport client class

**Key Discovery:** FastMCP v0.2.0+ already provides built-in SSE and streamable-http transport support, requiring only ~31 lines of configuration code instead of a full custom implementation.

**Files Modified:**
- `hexstrike_mcp.py`: +31 lines (CLI args, transport config)
- `hexstrike_server.py`: +120 lines (SessionManager, SSE endpoints) [existing]
- `test_mcp_sse_transport.py`: +180 lines (new test script)
- `README.md`: +80 lines (documentation and examples)
- `SSE_TRANSPORT_SUMMARY_V6.1_FINAL.md`: +400 lines (comprehensive guide)

**Total New Code: ~31 lines for MCP transport + test scripts + documentation**
