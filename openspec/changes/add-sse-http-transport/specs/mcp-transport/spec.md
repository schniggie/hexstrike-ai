### Requirement: Real-time Streaming Responses
The MCP transport layer SHALL support streaming responses for long-running security tool executions with progressive updates.

#### Scenario: Streaming scan progress
- **WHEN** a long-running security tool (e.g., nmap, nuclei) is executing
- **THEN** the MCP server SHALL stream progress updates via SSE events
- **AND** each progress update SHALL include percent complete, current phase, and elapsed time

- **WHEN** a vulnerability scanner discovers new findings during execution
- **THEN** each vulnerability SHALL be streamed immediately upon discovery
- **AND** vulnerability data SHALL include severity, CVE, description, and remediation

### Requirement: Multi-Agent Session Management
The MCP server SHALL support multiple concurrent AI agent connections with isolated session contexts.

#### Scenario: Concurrent agent connections
- **WHEN** multiple AI agents connect to HexStrike MCP server
- **THEN** each agent SHALL receive a unique session identifier
- **AND** each session SHALL maintain independent execution context

#### Scenario: Session authentication
- **WHEN** an AI agent attempts to connect via HTTP/SSE transport
- **THEN** the server SHALL require valid authentication credentials (token or API key)
- **AND** unauthenticated requests SHALL be rejected with 401 status
- **AND** authentication tokens SHALL have configurable expiration time

#### Scenario: Session cleanup
- **WHEN** an AI agent disconnects or times out
- **THEN** the server SHALL terminate associated tool executions
- **AND** the server SHALL clean up session resources (temp files, cache entries)
- **AND** the server SHALL log session termination for audit purposes

### Requirement: Transport Configuration
The MCP client and server SHALL support flexible transport configuration via command-line arguments and configuration files.

#### Scenario: Configure SSE endpoint
- **WHEN** administrator configures HexStrike MCP server
- **THEN** SSE endpoint URL SHALL be configurable via `--sse-endpoint` argument
- **AND** default endpoint SHALL be `http://localhost:8888/mcp/sse`
- **AND** endpoint SHALL support HTTPS for secure remote connections

#### Scenario: Configure authentication
- **WHEN** administrator enables authentication for remote access
- **THEN** authentication method SHALL be configurable (token, API key, OAuth)
- **AND** credentials SHALL be provided via environment variables or config file
- **AND** plaintext credentials SHALL never be logged or displayed

#### Scenario: Configure transport fallback
- **WHEN** primary transport (SSE/HTTP) fails to connect
- **THEN** the client SHALL optionally fallback to stdio transport if available
- **AND** fallback behavior SHALL be configurable via `--transport-fallback` flag
- **AND** connection errors SHALL be logged with detailed diagnostic information

### Requirement: Error Handling and Recovery
The MCP transport layer SHALL implement robust error handling with automatic recovery for network failures.

#### Scenario: Network connection loss
- **WHEN** SSE/HTTP connection is lost during tool execution
- **THEN** the client SHALL attempt to reconnect with exponential backoff
- **AND** maximum retry attempts SHALL be configurable (default: 5)
- **AND** in-progress tool executions SHALL continue on server side
- **AND** reconnection SHALL resume streaming from last successful checkpoint

#### Scenario: Server unavailability
- **WHEN** HexStrike MCP server is unreachable
- **THEN** the client SHALL retry connection according to backoff strategy
- **AND** after maximum retries, the client SHALL fail gracefully with descriptive error
- **AND** the AI agent SHALL receive actionable error message with troubleshooting steps

#### Scenario: Timeout handling
- **WHEN** a security tool execution exceeds configured timeout
- **THEN** the server SHALL terminate the tool process
- **AND** the server SHALL send timeout notification via stream
- **AND** partial results SHALL be returned to the AI agent
- **AND** timeout duration SHALL be configurable per-tool

### Requirement: Performance and Scalability
The MCP transport layer SHALL optimize performance for concurrent connections and minimize latency.

#### Scenario: Concurrent request handling
- **WHEN** 10+ AI agents submit simultaneous tool execution requests
- **THEN** the server SHALL handle requests concurrently using ThreadPoolExecutor
- **AND** request processing SHALL not block other connections
- **AND** maximum concurrent connections SHALL be configurable (default: 50)

#### Scenario: Streaming latency optimization
- **WHEN** streaming tool output over SSE/HTTP
- **THEN** output chunks SHALL be delivered within 100ms of availability
- **AND** network buffer sizes SHALL be optimized for real-time streaming
- **AND** compression SHALL be used for large output payloads (>1MB)

#### Scenario: Resource limits
- **WHEN** server resource usage exceeds configured thresholds
- **THEN** new connection requests SHALL be rejected with 503 Service Unavailable
- **AND** existing connections SHALL continue processing
- **AND** resource monitoring SHALL log CPU, memory, and connection counts

### Requirement: Backward Compatibility
The MCP implementation SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing stdio-based integrations.

#### Scenario: Stdio-only clients
- **WHEN** an AI agent connects via stdio transport (existing behavior)
- **THEN** the MCP client SHALL function identically to pre-SSE/HTTP implementation
- **AND** no configuration changes SHALL be required for stdio clients
- **AND** stdio transport SHALL remain the default for subprocess invocations

#### Scenario: Mixed transport environments
- **WHEN** some AI agents use stdio and others use HTTP/SSE
- **THEN** both transport types SHALL be supported simultaneously
- **AND** tool execution and caching SHALL work consistently across transports
- **AND** no behavioral differences SHALL exist between transport types
